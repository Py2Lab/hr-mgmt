    Oh,
Goodbye my Coney Island baby,
farewell my one true love, (true love) (my honey)
I'm gonna go away and leave you
never to see you any (never gonna see you any)
I'm gonna sail upon that ferry boat,
never to return again (return again)
so goodbye, farewell, so long forever,
Good bye my Coney Isle, Good bye my Coney Isle, Good bye my Coney Island

We all fall for some girl that dresses neat,
some girl that's got big feet,
we meet her on the street.
Then we'll join the
army of married b****
to the altar
Just list leading lambs to slaughter (alternate: "Don't forget to wash the dishes")
When it's over, oh boy we get it good,
bachelor days we then recall...

 Rich man, poor man, beggar man, theif,
doctor, lawyer, merchant, chief,
we all, are bound for...
Goodbye my Coney Island baby,
farewell my one true love, (true love) (my honey)
I'm gonna go away and leave you
never to see you any (never gonna see you any)
I'm gonna sail upon that ferry boat,
never to return again (return again)
so goodbye, farewell, so long forever,
Good bye my Coney Isle, Good bye my Coney Isle, Good bye my Coney Island Babe!
(Bye my Coney island Babe!)
